/**
 * We want to sort out our mappings and events into three categories
 * 1. `unmappedEvents` are events that are yet to be mapped either due to being 
 * recently added and a worklog does not exists for it or there is a worklog that it can be mapped to
 * 2. `mappedEvents` are events that we do know that exist and have a worklog associated with it
 * 3. `deletedEvents` are mappings that have an event associated with them but
 * that event can't be found, which most likely meanst that it was deleted
 * 
 * NOTE: deletedEventMappings are type ICalEventWorklogMappings because the event associated with the mapping has been deleted
 * ```
